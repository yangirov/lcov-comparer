A script to compare code coverage between two `lcov.info` reports and generate a visual HTML report with diffs for:

- Statements
- Branches
- Functions
- Lines

## 🚀 Usage

```sh
npx lcov-comparer coverage-old.info coverage-new.info

open coverage-diff.html
```

## 📦 Format Support

Compatible with lcov.info format generated by:

- vitest --coverage
- jest --coverage

## 📁 Output File

The script generates the file: `coverage-diff.html`

Open it in your browser to view a sortable table showing per-file coverage differences between the two reports.

Example table:

| File       | Statements    | Δ      | Branches      | Δ      | Functions      | Δ      | Lines         | Δ      |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------ | -------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------ |
| src/app.ts | 70.0% → 90.0% | +20.0% | 40.0% → 80.0% | +40.0% | 50.0% → 100.0% | +50.0% | 70.0% → 90.0% | +20.0% |

Files are automatically sorted by the most significant coverage change across all metrics.
